            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 â€“ September 7, 2018), 
                known professionally as Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer, 
                songwriter, and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Miller 
                began his career in Pittsburgh's hip hop scene in 2007, at the age of 
                fifteen. In 2010, he signed a record deal with independent label Rostrum 
                Records, and released his breakthrough mixtapes K.I.D.S. (2010) and Best 
                Day Ever (2011). Miller's debut studio album, Blue Slide Park (2011), 
                became the first independently-distributed debut album to top the US 
                Billboard 200 since 1995.</p>
