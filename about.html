            <p>Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 â€“ September 7, 2018), 
                known professionally as Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer, 
                songwriter, and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Miller 
                began his career in Pittsburgh's hip hop scene in 2007, at the age of 
                fifteen. In 2010, he signed a record deal with independent label Rostrum 
                Records, and released his breakthrough mixtapes K.I.D.S. (2010) and Best 
                Day Ever (2011). Miller's debut studio album, Blue Slide Park (2011), 
                became the first independently-distributed debut album to top the US 
                Billboard 200 since 1995.</p>
            <p>In 2013, he founded the record label imprint REMember Music. After his 
                second studio album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off (2013), he left 
                Rostrum and signed with the major label Warner Bros. Records in 2014. With 
                them, he released four studio albums: GO:OD AM (2015), The Divine Feminine 
                (2016), Swimming (2018), and the posthumous Circles (2020). For Swimming, 
                he was posthumously nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. He 
                also served as a record producer for various artists, including himself, 
                under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman.</p>
